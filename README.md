# Develop Data Product

This repo contains codes for the final project of the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/) from Coursera.com.  The final project is to create a ShinyApp and an slidify pitch to explain what the shinyapp is about. The one I did is about food safety using FDA's food safety ratings.

This course is the last one at the [9 Courses Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) for Johns Hopkins University. There are lots of examples for this and other courses in this  specialization at their [github repos](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses).
